### Android Developer Nanodegree
# Popular Movies
## Project Overview
> In this project students will build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
> The app will:
>- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
>- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
>  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
>- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information and functionality.
>  - Title, Movie poster and backdrop, Plot Synopsis, User rating and Release date
>  - View and play trailers (either in YouTube or a web browser).
>  - Read Reviews of the selected movie.
>  - Allow the user to mark a movie as a favorite and maintain a local movies collection that doesn't require an API request.
>- Optimize the app experience for both phones and tablets.

## Why this Project?
> To become an Android developer, students must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, needing to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces, fetch data from network services and optimize the experience for various mobile devices.
>
> By building this app, students will demonstrate an understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. The app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## Learning Outcomes
>- Fetch data from the internet with theMovieDB API.
>- Use Adapters and to populate RecyclerViews.
>- Incorporate libraries to reduce and simplify boilerplate code.
>- Build a fully featured application which looks and feels natural.
>- Optimize the UI experience with a master/detail flow.
